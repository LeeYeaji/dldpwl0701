							<b class="text_title ">Maya</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mesoamerica, a geographic region that includes Central America and southern Mexico, was home to several civilizations that were arguably the most complex of the ancient world. For over two millennia, sociopolitical entities such as the Olmec, Mayan, and Aztec civilizations dominated this area and created a shared culture that was <span class="pointer_grey">characterized</span> by its remarkable scientific, technological, and artistic achievements.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these early societies, the Mayan is widely considered to be the most influential on the development of the region, due primarily to its longevity and social stability. The extensive period of cultural continuity, spanning from approximately 2000 BC until AD 1500, enabled the Mayans to create a society that had a profound impact on coincident and subsequent Mesoamerican civilizations, and that is widely considered by modern archeologists to represent the zenith of pre-Columbian culture in the Americas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of the Mayan civilization was dependent on the use of intensive and efficient agricultural techniques to produce the provisions required to feed a large population, with maize—a grain that is similar to modern corn—beans, squash, and chili peppers serving as the primary dietary staples.  In the early stages of Mayan development, the most common form of agriculture involved the swidden technique, whereby sections of the rainforest were cleared with the use of fire, cultivated for a season, and then abandoned to be overgrown by the forest.  However, as the size of the population increased, this primitive method was discarded in favor of the establishment of permanent agricultural areas that included terraced fields and gardens in which crop production was alternated with fallow periods to ensure fertility.  Concurrent with this transition to stable cultivation practices was the development of irrigation technology, which allowed for the implementation of a complex system of reservoirs and raised canals to increase agricultural production. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The productivity of Mayan agriculture allowed for the development of an urbanized society with a high population density. The typical Mayan city was a hierarchical political unit governed by a hereditary ruler who enjoyed absolute authority over the lives of his subjects, and temporal and secular powers were closely connected, with the king often performing essential religious functions as well. All other positions of significance within the community were dominated by the nobility, and specific clans usually retained control over important civil, religious, or military functions through the vehicle of hereditary titles. At the lower end of the hierarchy were the merchants, farmers, and artisans, who enjoyed little social mobility and were responsible for the bulk of the tax burden, as well as providing military service when required.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archeologists have long remarked on the similarities between the Mayan and Classical Greek civilizations, in that each consisted of a multitude of sovereign city-states that shared a common cultural, linguistic, and religious background. Although individual Mayan polities often expanded to assert their hegemony over others, the composite units almost always maintained their identity as distinct entities rather than being directly administered by or incorporated into the conquering power.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Mayan civilization was politically fragmented, it was culturally cohesive due to the extensive commercial and religious bonds that tied the various states together. These links were further strengthened by the existence of shared writing and mathematics systems, widely employed by the highly educated social elite, which contributed to the development of Mayan science and art.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using elaborate books known as codices, created by binding uniform pieces of fig tree bark with animal hide, the Mayans recorded all of their extensive knowledge on subjects as diverse as astronomy, architecture, and genealogy. The history of the Mayan people was also recorded using elaborate hieroglyphics carved into a stone monument, the accuracy of which was greatly facilitated by the development of a sophisticated calendar based on a complex cycle of 20-, 52-, and 260-year periods that was much more precise in its measurements of celestial phenomena than any other from this period of human history.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other Mesoamerican cultures, the Mayan decline was gradual and is not attributable to war or a similar catastrophic event. Recent research suggests that it may have been the result of changes to the climate that made it difficult to produce the large volumes of food required to support the population, although in the absence of conclusive evidence, the underlying cause continues to remain a mystery.<br>

The extensive period of cultural continuity, spanning from approximately 2000 BC until AD 1500, enabled the Mayans to create a society that had a profound impact on coincident and <span class="pointer_grey">subsequent</span> Mesoamerican civilizations, and that is widely considered by modern archeologists to represent the zenith of pre-Columbian culture in the Americas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of the Mayan civilization was dependent on the use of intensive and efficient agricultural techniques to produce the provisions required to feed a large population, with maize—a grain that is similar to modern corn—beans, squash, and chili peppers serving as the primary dietary staples.  In the early stages of Mayan development, the most common form of agriculture involved the swidden technique, whereby sections of the rainforest were cleared with the use of fire, cultivated for a season, and then abandoned to be overgrown by the forest.  However, as the size of the population increased, this primitive method was discarded in favor of the establishment of permanent agricultural areas that included terraced fields and gardens in which crop production was alternated with fallow periods to ensure fertility.  Concurrent with this transition to stable cultivation practices was the development of irrigation technology, which allowed for the implementation of a complex system of reservoirs and raised canals to increase agricultural production. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The productivity of Mayan agriculture allowed for the development of an urbanized society with a high population density. The typical Mayan city was a hierarchical political unit governed by a hereditary ruler who enjoyed absolute authority over the lives of his subjects, and temporal and secular powers were closely connected, with the king often performing essential religious functions as well. All other positions of significance within the community were dominated by the nobility, and specific clans usually retained control over important civil, religious, or military functions through the vehicle of hereditary titles. At the lower end of the hierarchy were the merchants, farmers, and artisans, who enjoyed little social mobility and were responsible for the bulk of the tax burden, as well as providing military service when required.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archeologists have long remarked on the similarities between the Mayan and Classical Greek civilizations, in that each consisted of a multitude of sovereign city-states that shared a common cultural, linguistic, and religious background. Although individual Mayan polities often expanded to assert their hegemony over others, the composite units almost always maintained their identity as distinct entities rather than being directly administered by or incorporated into the conquering power.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Mayan civilization was politically fragmented, it was culturally cohesive due to the extensive commercial and religious bonds that tied the various states together. These links were further strengthened by the existence of shared writing and mathematics systems, widely employed by the highly educated social elite, which contributed to the development of Mayan science and art.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using elaborate books known as codices, created by binding uniform pieces of fig tree bark with animal hide, the Mayans recorded all of their extensive knowledge on subjects as diverse as astronomy, architecture, and genealogy. The history of the Mayan people was also recorded using elaborate hieroglyphics carved into a stone monument, the accuracy of which was greatly facilitated by the development of a sophisticated calendar based on a complex cycle of 20-, 52-, and 260-year periods that was much more precise in its measurements of celestial phenomena than any other from this period of human history.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other Mesoamerican cultures, the Mayan decline was gradual and is not attributable to war or a similar catastrophic event. Recent research suggests that it may have been the result of changes to the climate that made it difficult to produce the large volumes of food required to support the population, although in the absence of conclusive evidence, the underlying cause continues to remain a mystery.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mesoamerica, a geographic region that includes Central America and southern Mexico, was home to several civilizations that were arguably the most complex of the ancient world. For over two millennia, sociopolitical entities such as the Olmec, Mayan, and Aztec civilizations dominated this area and created a shared culture that was characterized by its remarkable scientific, technological, and artistic achievements.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these early societies, the Mayan is widely considered to be the most influential on the development of the region, due primarily to its longevity and social stability. The extensive period of cultural continuity, spanning from approximately 2000 BC until AD 1500, enabled the Mayans to create a society that had a profound impact on coincident and subsequent Mesoamerican civilizations, and that is widely considered by modern archeologists to represent the zenith of pre-Columbian culture in the Americas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of the Mayan civilization was dependent on the use of intensive and efficient agricultural techniques to produce the provisions required to feed a large population, with maize—a grain that is similar to modern corn—beans, squash, and chili peppers serving as the primary dietary staples.  In the early stages of Mayan development, the most common form of agriculture involved the swidden technique, whereby sections of the rainforest were cleared with the use of fire, cultivated for a season, and then abandoned to be overgrown by the forest.  However, as the size of the population increased, this primitive method was discarded in favor of the establishment of permanent agricultural areas that included terraced fields and gardens in which crop production was alternated with fallow periods to ensure fertility.  Concurrent with this transition to stable cultivation practices was the development of irrigation technology, which allowed for the implementation of a complex system of reservoirs and raised canals to increase agricultural production. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The productivity of Mayan agriculture allowed for the development of an urbanized society with a high population density. The typical Mayan city was a hierarchical political unit governed by a hereditary ruler who enjoyed absolute authority over the lives of his subjects, and temporal and secular powers were closely connected, with the king often performing essential religious functions as well. All other positions of significance within the community were dominated by the nobility, and specific clans usually retained control over important civil, religious, or military functions through the vehicle of hereditary titles. At the lower end of the hierarchy were the merchants, farmers, and artisans, who enjoyed little social mobility and were responsible for the bulk of the tax burden, as well as providing military service when required.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archeologists have long remarked on the similarities between the Mayan and Classical Greek civilizations, in that each consisted of a multitude of sovereign city-states that shared a common cultural, linguistic, and religious background. <span class="pointer_grey">Although individual Mayan polities often expanded to assert their hegemony over others, the composite units almost always maintained their identity as distinct entities rather than being directly administered by or incorporated into the conquering power.</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Mayan civilization was politically fragmented, it was culturally cohesive due to the extensive commercial and religious bonds that tied the various states together. These links were further strengthened by the existence of shared writing and mathematics systems, widely employed by the highly educated social elite, which contributed to the development of Mayan science and art.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using elaborate books known as codices, created by binding uniform pieces of fig tree bark with animal hide, the Mayans recorded all of their extensive knowledge on subjects as diverse as astronomy, architecture, and genealogy. The history of the Mayan people was also recorded using elaborate hieroglyphics carved into a stone monument, the accuracy of which was greatly facilitated by the development of a sophisticated calendar based on a complex cycle of 20-, 52-, and 260-year periods that was much more precise in its measurements of celestial phenomena than any other from this period of human history.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other Mesoamerican cultures, the Mayan decline was gradual and is not attributable to war or a similar catastrophic event. Recent research suggests that it may have been the result of changes to the climate that made it difficult to produce the large volumes of food required to support the population, although in the absence of conclusive evidence, the underlying cause continues to remain a mystery.<br>

								<b class="text_title">Maya</b>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mesoamerica, a geographic region that includes Central America and southern Mexico, was home to several civilizations that were arguably the most complex of the ancient world. For over two millennia, sociopolitical entities such as the Olmec, Mayan, and Aztec civilizations dominated this area and created a shared culture that was characterized by its remarkable scientific, technological, and artistic achievements.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these early societies, the Mayan is widely considered to be the most influential on the development of the region, due primarily to its longevity and social stability. The extensive period of cultural continuity, spanning from approximately 2000 BC until AD 1500, enabled the Mayans to create a society that had a profound impact on coincident and subsequent Mesoamerican civilizations, and that is widely considered by modern archeologists to represent the zenith of pre-Columbian culture in the Americas.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of the Mayan civilization was dependent on the use of intensive and efficient agricultural techniques to produce the provisions required to feed a large population, with maize—a grain that is similar to modern corn—beans, squash, and chili peppers serving as the primary dietary staples.<label for="1"><span class="rc_13_rect">■</span></label> In the early stages of Mayan development, the most common form of agriculture involved the swidden technique, whereby sections of the rainforest were cleared with the use of fire, cultivated for a season, and then abandoned to be overgrown by the forest. <label for="2"><span class="rc_13_rect">■</span></label> However, as the size of the population increased, this primitive method was discarded in favor of the establishment of permanent agricultural areas that included terraced fields and gardens in which crop production was alternated with fallow periods to ensure fertility. <label for="3"><span class="rc_13_rect">■</span></label> Concurrent with this transition to stable cultivation practices was the development of irrigation technology, which allowed for the implementation of a complex system of reservoirs and raised canals to increase agricultural production. <label for="4"><span class="rc_13_rect">■</span></label><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The productivity of Mayan agriculture allowed for the development of an urbanized society with a high population density. The typical Mayan city was a hierarchical political unit governed by a hereditary ruler who enjoyed absolute authority over the lives of his subjects, and temporal and secular powers were closely connected, with the king often performing essential religious functions as well. All other positions of significance within the community were dominated by the nobility, and specific clans usually retained control over important civil, religious, or military functions through the vehicle of hereditary titles. At the lower end of the hierarchy were the merchants, farmers, and artisans, who enjoyed little social mobility and were responsible for the bulk of the tax burden, as well as providing military service when required.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archeologists have long remarked on the similarities between the Mayan and Classical Greek civilizations, in that each consisted of a multitude of sovereign city-states that shared a common cultural, linguistic, and religious background. Although individual Mayan polities often expanded to assert their hegemony over others, the composite units almost always maintained their identity as distinct entities rather than being directly administered by or incorporated into the conquering power.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Mayan civilization was politically fragmented, it was culturally cohesive due to the extensive commercial and religious bonds that tied the various states together. These links were further strengthened by the existence of shared writing and mathematics systems, widely employed by the highly educated social elite, which contributed to the development of Mayan science and art.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using elaborate books known as codices, created by binding uniform pieces of fig tree bark with animal hide, the Mayans recorded all of their extensive knowledge on subjects as diverse as astronomy, architecture, and genealogy. The history of the Mayan people was also recorded using elaborate hieroglyphics carved into a stone monument, the accuracy of which was greatly facilitated by the development of a sophisticated calendar based on a complex cycle of 20-, 52-, and 260-year periods that was much more precise in its measurements of celestial phenomena than any other from this period of human history.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other Mesoamerican cultures, the Mayan decline was gradual and is not attributable to war or a similar catastrophic event. Recent research suggests that it may have been the result of changes to the climate that made it difficult to produce the large volumes of food required to support the population, although in the absence of conclusive evidence, the underlying cause continues to remain a mystery.<br><input type="hidden" name="rc13" value="">
